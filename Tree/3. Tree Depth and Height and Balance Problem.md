### **1. Maximum Depth**

**Problem**: Find the maximum depth of a binary tree (the longest path from the root node to the furthest leaf node, in terms of the number of nodes).
**Solution**:
- **Recursive**: `max(left subtree depth, right subtree depth) + 1`
- **Iterative**: Use level-order traversal (BFS) to calculate the number of levels.
```python
def maxDepth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    return max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right)) + 1
```
```python
# BFS
def maxDepth_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([root])
    depth = 0
    while queue:
        depth += 1
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
    return depth
```
### **2. Minimum Depth**

**Problem**: Find the minimum depth of a binary tree (the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node, in terms of the number of nodes).
**Key Point**: A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.
**Trap of Minimum Depth**: When a node has only one child, special handling of the empty subtree is required to avoid incorrectly calculating the depth.
```python
def minDepth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    if not root.left:
        return minDepth(root.right) + 1
    if not root.right:
        return minDepth(root.left) + 1
    return min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right)) + 1
```
```python
# BFS More efficient: return as soon as a leaf node is encountered
def minDepth_bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([(root, 1)])
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.popleft()
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return depth
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, depth + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, depth + 1))
```
### **3. Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced**

**Problem**: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a **balanced binary tree**. A binary tree is considered balanced if, for every node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees does not exceed 1.

**Solution**:

- **Recursive Approach**:
  - Check the height of the left and right subtrees of each node.
  - If at any point, the height difference between the left and right subtrees exceeds 1, the tree is not balanced.
  - The height of a subtree can be calculated recursively by checking the height of its left and right subtrees.

- **Efficiency**:
  - This problem can be solved efficiently in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, by using a post-order traversal.

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        # Helper function: Recursively calculate the height of each subtree
        def checkDepth(node):
            # Base case: If the node is None, return height 0
            if not node:
                return 0

            # Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees
            left_depth = checkDepth(node.left)
            right_depth = checkDepth(node.right)

            # If either subtree is unbalanced, or the height difference exceeds 1, return -1
            if left_depth == -1 or right_depth == -1 or abs(left_depth - right_depth) > 1:
                return -1

            # Return the height of the current node (max of left and right subtrees' height + 1)
            return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

        # If the result is -1, the tree is unbalanced; otherwise, it's balanced
        return checkDepth(root) != -1
```
```python
#DFS
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return True, 0
            left_balanced, left_depth = dfs(node.left)
            right_balanced, right_depth = dfs(node.right)
            if not left_balanced or not right_balanced:
                return False, 0
            if abs(left_depth - right_depth) > 1:
                return False, 0
            return True, max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
        return dfs(root)[0]
```
### **4. Diameter of Binary Tree**

**Problem**: Given a binary tree, find the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The path length is the number of edges between the nodes.
**Solution**:
- The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes, which can either pass through the root or not.
- To compute the diameter, we need to traverse the tree and for each node, calculate the sum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.
- The longest path will be the one where the sum of the left and right subtree depths is maximum.

**Approach**:
- Use **Depth First Search (DFS)** to calculate the depth of the tree.
- While doing the DFS, at each node, calculate the **longest path** that passes through that node, and update the global `max_diameter`.

```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(root):
    max_diameter = 0

    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal max_diameter
        if not node:
            return 0

        left_depth = dfs(node.left)
        right_depth = dfs(node.right)

        # Update the maximum diameter (longest path passing through the current node)
        max_diameter = max(max_diameter, left_depth + right_depth)

        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

    dfs(root)
    return max_diameter
```

### **5. Binary Tree Paths**

**Problem**: Given a binary tree, find all paths from the root node to the leaf nodes. A path is defined as the sequence of nodes along the path from the root to a leaf node.
**Solution**:
- The task is to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.
- We can use **Depth First Search (DFS)** to traverse the tree, and during the traversal, we keep track of the current path.
- Once we reach a leaf node (a node with no left or right children), we add the path to the result

**Approach**:
- Perform a DFS starting from the root node.
- Keep track of the current path and append the node’s value as you go deeper.
- If you reach a leaf node, add the path to the result list.

```python
def binaryTreePaths(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []

    def dfs(node, path):
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            # Reached a leaf node, add the path
            result.append('->'.join(path + [str(node.val)]))
            return

        if node.left:
            dfs(node.left, path + [str(node.val)])
        if node.right:
            dfs(node.right, path + [str(node.val)])

    dfs(root, [])
    return result
```
### **6. Path Sum**
**Problem**: Determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that the sum of all node values along the path equals the target sum.
```python
def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):
    if not root:
        return False

    # If it's a leaf node, check if it equals the target sum
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == targetSum

    # Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    remaining = targetSum - root.val
    return (hasPathSum(root.left, remaining) or
            hasPathSum(root.right, remaining))
```
### **7.Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum:**
**Key Insights**
1. Path Types at Each Node
For any node, there are two types of paths to consider:
Through-node path: Left subtree → Node → Right subtree
Single-branch path: Either left OR right subtree → Node (for parent)

2. Why Post-order Traversal?
We need bottom-up information gathering:
Process children first to get their maximum contributions
Then decide at current node: include both children vs single branch

LeetCode 124 - Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
```
def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    self.max_sum = float('-inf')

    def helper(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        #There are negative numbers involved.
        left = max(0, helper(node.left))
        right = max(0, helper(node.right))
        self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, left + right + node.val)
        return max(left, right) + node.val
```
